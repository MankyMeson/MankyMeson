- Whassup everyone, I'm Clio and this is my personal GitHub account.
- I'm mainly interested in computational physics, and I'm currently studying quantum Monte Carlo methods.
- Other interests include compiler development (I'm quite new to this one), theoretical condensed matter physics, and dungeons and dragons.
- Don't expect high quality code to be uploaded here
